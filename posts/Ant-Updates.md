I made some updates to my [Varnerized ANT CNC]($rootpath/pages/Varnerized_Ant.html).
I'm pretty happy with how this looks, sits on a table, and functions. It's finally become a tool I can just setup and use, rather than one I have to tweak with constantly to get decent results.

Maybe someday I'll make a bigger CNC...

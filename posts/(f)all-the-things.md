Since the last post, I've...
  * Started writing my own Gerber X2/X3 file handling library and I've learned a lot.
  * Spent months doing PT for my elbow. It didn't work. I had tennis elbow surgery (the open kind) about four weeks ago.
  * The Wife had a major surgery go major sideways. She's fine now. We're lucky to have her with us, and for her to still be herself. :-)
  * I built a bookcase / sofa table style piece of furniture from Ash for the wife. It's nice. I'll post photos some day.
  * Started playing Minecraft with The Kids. Hoo boy. That's a time sink.

I designed a very-thin but functional [PCB Stencil Jig](https://github.com/bvarner/bricabrac/tree/master/tools/StencilMachine) that fits wholly within the 28mm high cavity of my UV curing station beneath my [Varnerized ANT CNC]($rootpath/pages/Varnerized_Ant.html).

The final design is published as the [MakerBeam Based PCB Stencil Jig](https://www.printables.com/model/250661-makerbeam-based-pcb-stencil-jig) on printables.com.

This is not a full 4-axis design, but it does allow for fine adjustment of skew and positioning on the X and Y axes independent of one another.

I've successfully used the jig (before it was fully complete) for soldermask mask alignment and curing (the entire device fits into my curing station) and the results so far have been quite acceptable.

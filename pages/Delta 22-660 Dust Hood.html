<h2>Why and How</h2>
<p>Years ago, I procured a Delta 22-660 Planer. It's a 13&quot; model that was built in the 1980's, and these stout machines are fantastic.</p>
<p><img src="../pages/Delta-22-660-dust-hood/nameplate.jpg" alt="test image" /></p>
<p>At the time I bought it, it had no dust-port / shroud / hood on the back, and the gentleman I purchased it from told me he only ran it outside, and taped a piece of cardboard to the back to deflect chips. He was the original owner.</p>
<p>Over the last thirteen years I've run hundreds of board feet (possibly thousands) through this machine, and produced a ton of dust... I had made a sheet-metal hood that was very... boxy, and would get clogged regularly.</p>
<p>Since first building a 3d printer I've dreamed of being able to design and build a dust hood for this machine. I finally did it.</p>
<p>It turns out, there might be quite a bit of demand for these. The original OEM parts were cast-iron, and sell once in a great while on e-bay for nearly $450 USD. That's more than I paid for my planer, knife setting jigs, and extra set of knives.
Having taken up Fusion360 in the last year (farewell, OpenSCAD -- you served me for a time) with the hobbiest license, it was time to revisit this idea.
The result is a print-it-yourself <a href="https://a360.co/3xQ8jW9">Fusion360 model of a dust hood for a Delta 22-660 13&quot; planer</a>.</p>
<p>This hood should fit any machine that has similar model numbers to this one:</p>
<p><a href="https://a360.co/3xQ8jW9"><img src="../pages/Delta-22-660-dust-hood/Model.jpg" alt="A screenshot of the model" /></a></p>
<p>I used four M3 bolts to anchor it to the top plate, as well as M8 socket cap screws to attach the bottom to the back of the planer.</p>

<h3>Assembly</h3>
<p>The design prints in 3 parts. It's parametric for wall size and some other settings. I've assembled mine with zip-ties
and silicone caulk between mating surfaces of the printed parts to form a gasket.</p>

<h3>Design</h3>
<p>During the design phase, I took my time and made several test pieces for critical spacing prior to printing.
I would do this by slicing the model just a few layers thick, omitting top &amp; bottom solid fill, and using a honeycomb
and the cheapest filament I have on hand.</p>

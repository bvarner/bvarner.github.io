8:30 AM: TA is at 220. Down from yesterday, but due to the rain not as far down as I'd have liked it to go with 24oz
 of Acid. PH is at 6.8. I expected that from the acid + rain. Another 30 oz of ph UP and we should be at 7.6...  I
  had 12 oz left in the bag. Uh oh. Made a trip to the stores with the boy and we got a gallon of acid and two bags
   of PH UP. Clearly I'll be using more UP than DOWN, so long as I don't overdose the UP. Got home, added 18 more oz.
   
   Took about 20 minutes to manually skim some spots, maintain the pool vacuum, clean it's micro filter, backwash
    from the clarifier last night, etc. Twenty minutes a day I can do. I can take a cup of coffee out with me and
     knock that out in no time.
   
11:00 AM: PH is at 7.6. OK. Pool is OPEN.

We swam. We enjoyed it. The kids spent a lot of time in the pool. I expect the novelty will wear off.

I need to figure out a way to put a basketball hoop or something over one-end of it...


9:00 PM: Dumped 24oz of Acid in to try and bring down the TA over night.

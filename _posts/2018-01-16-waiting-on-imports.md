While we're waiting for the import parts to arrive, there is plenty to do. I've been making progress on the wooden frame, and first iteration of ABS parts have been printed by my friend Sam. All the source for the STLs and DXFs and what-not are in the [Varnerized Prusa i3 development branch](https://github.com/bvarner/varnerized_prusa_i3/tree/development). Let's have a look at what we've done so far.

* I placed 16 orders on aliexpress.com. 3 Have arrived. I also placed an order or two from Amazon for Blue ABS and black PLA. All the Amazon goods are here.
* Converted the Prusa DXF files for the MK3 frame into SCAD sources that produce router templates in STL format. I've printed and glued the PLA frame templates together.
* I spent some spare moments in the shop putting together a frame of 1/2 plywood strips sandwiched between 1/8" strips of poplar, some 1/2" plywood laminations for the frame supports, and the front and back.
* Put together
* Sam printed all my initial STLs for the printer parts in Blue ABS. They're gorgeous.

_The frame parts and router templates adheared with carpet tape. The blocks of plywood are the blanks for the extrusion replacements._

Now we wait for the 1/4" flush-trim router bits to be delivered (should be today) and then... we rout.
I may try gluing up two sheets of high-grade 1/4" plywood to make a 'thinner' y-carriage. I fear the 3/4" plywood may prove too 'heavy' and lead to excessive shaking during printing.

After routing / milling / cutting / drilling, I'll be taking some time to sand things a bit, then giving them a coat of primer. I do want this thing to look decent when it's done.

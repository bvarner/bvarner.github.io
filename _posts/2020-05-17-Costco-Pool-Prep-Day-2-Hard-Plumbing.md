We found the valves (and all the other couplings) from the last post at a big-box store on the other end of town. The
 'pool valves' that I found aren't stocked at all those big-box locations. But a 20 minute drive to the other side of
  Indianapolis got us what we needed.
 
After finishing the hard-plumbing on Sunday, it was time to start water filtering / treatment. Oh Boy.

So Sunday night I shocked the pool and dumped a pint each of clarifier and stain remover. Let the pump run overnight.

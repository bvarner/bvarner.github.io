Friday Morning: Water is less cloudy. Yay. Still a bit milky. But it's clearer than it was yesterday.
I won't be adding any more clarifier today, if I can resist the urge.

TA Tested at 200. Another 24oz of Acid have been added. I think next year I'm just going to dump a gallon and a half
 in on day 1.
 
Running out of test Solution #3. Going to have to order more.

Pump is off and acid is sitting. I seem to get a more effective TA drop when I let it rest.

Friday Mid-Afternoon: Vacuumed pool. Only had to backwash once. Turning the pump on and off kicks a cloud of nasty
 crap out of the sand filter. Yick. There has to be a better way to start this thing.
 
TA Tested ~220. maybe I had more water in the vial? Maybe my drops we smaller? I don't know.

I'm going to re-test and dump more acid in. Water is clearing up considerably. I'll skip today for clarifier if I can.
Added another inch or so of water back into the pool, using the softened water from the bathroom faucet through a
 window. It didn't seem to make too big of a mess of the water, but things are still cloudy.

Friday Evening: Mowed. While the pump was disconnected I dropped another 24oz of Acid in.
Once the mowing was done, I turned the pump back on and couldn't hold out on the clarifier. I put another ounce in.
I also Ordered a bottle of clarifier that says it's won't cause eye inflammation. I really don't want to keep using the
 bottle I have.

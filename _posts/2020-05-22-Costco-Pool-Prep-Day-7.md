Friday Morning: Water is less cloudy. Yay. Still a bit milky. But it's clearer than it was yesterday.
I won't be adding any more clarifier today, if I can resist the urge.

TA Tested at 200. Another 24oz of Acid have been added. I think next year I'm just going to dump a gallon and a half
 in on day 1.
 
Running out of test Solution #3. Going to have to order more.

Pump is off and acid is sitting. I seem to get a more effective TA drop when I let it rest.

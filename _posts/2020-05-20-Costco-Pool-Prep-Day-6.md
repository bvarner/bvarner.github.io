Thursday Morning: Water less cloudy. Lots of pale sediment on the floor of pool. Not the dark brown stuff we had from
 the initial well water. This is different. But, you can _see_ to the bottom of the pool, even though it's somewhat
  milky water.
  
TA Tested at 28 drops to clear, or 270. We dropped it 50 with a pint of acid. Oh My.

Dropped in 24oz of Acid (pint and a half). Let is sit for an hour.

Added another 1.5oz of Clarifier. I don't want to keep adding this junk, but it seems to have plenty of stuff to bind
 with and get pulled out of the water. I'm going to need to order more. Yikes.
 
Turned the pump on. I'll retest in another 4 or 5 hours. If this is a linear change, we should be near 195.

I need another gallon of acid before I treat the pool again.

Wednesday morning: Water still cloudy. Bottom of the pool has a nice even coating of light-brown, very fine sediment
. It's not filter sand. Yay. Spent an hour hand-vacuuming the bottom of the pool. Every 45-seconds to two minutes I
 had to backwash the filter, as the fine sediment from the bottom seemed to be clogging it up and keeping water from
  flowing. I think I'll need to disconnect the sand filter and backwash with fresh hose water. In the next day or so.
  
After an hour of vacuum, backwash, rinse, repeat I had the bottom of the pool cleaned up considerably more than when
 I started.
 
Did another total Alkalinity test. Results are still Over 250. Re-read the instructions for my test kit last night
, and it looks like the water should turn yellow or clear. I can see drops briefly turning clear now. So there's
 progress. Added another pint (16 oz) of Acid. The jug is getting light.
 
Wednesday Mid-day: Added 2oz of super-clarifier. Retested TA. Over 250. Dropped another pint of acid. Waited an
 hour, turned the pump back on.
 
Wednesday Evening: Tested TA. 33 drops (320) and the indicator solution went clear. Hot dog! We're closing in.
Added another pint of acid. Let it sit for an hour, turned the pump back on. Let it run all night.

Wednesday morning: Water still cloudy. Bottom of the pool has a nice even coating of light-brown, very fine sediment
. It's not filter sand. Yay. Spent an hour hand-vacuuming the bottom of the pool. Every 45-seconds to two minutes I
 had to backwash the filter, as the fine sediment from the bottom seemed to be clogging it up and keeping water from
  flowing. I think I'll need to disconnect the sand filter and backwash with fresh hose water. In the next day or so.
  
After an hour of vacuum, backwash, rinse, repeat I had the bottom of the pool cleaned up considerably more than when
 I started.
 
Did another total Alkalinity test. Results are still Over 250. Re-read the instructions for my test kit last night
, and it looks like the water should turn yellow or clear. I can see drops briefly turning clear now. So there's
 progress. Added another pint (16 oz) of Acid. The jug is getting light.

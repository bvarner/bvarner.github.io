After spending a bit of time with a Prusa i3 MK2 3-d printer at the office, it's become apparent to me that this is a tool I'd love to have access to at home, in the shop. So begins my effort to create a [Varnerized open-source Prusa clone](https://github.com/bvarner/varnerized_prusa_i3), aided by information from others who have pulled this off, and a friend with an Original Prusa i3 MK2s at home.

I'm starting from [Tom's Dolly](https://toms3d.org/dolly), an MK2 clone, but updating my build to use the MK3 frame and Y-carriage. Rather than taking the same path as Tom, I'm not focused on making the _cheapest possible_, I'm focused on making the _most initially capable_ for $225, while allowing for upgrades / improvements over time. It's very reminiscent of the early PC days. I'd start building a system with the pivotal parts being the best I could afford, and make educated trade-offs, then upgrade those chepaer components later on. It worked well for me then, and I think it will work well for me now, too.

In early January, I made my initial order from AliExpress, sourcing import parts from a number of suppliers. As those start to arrive I'll document things in more detail, and I plan on posting a page when I'm done detailing the parts, the build, and the firmware process.

For now, I've got the router templates for the MK3 frame created, and my friend, Sam, is printing my Blue ABS parts on his Prusa MK2s at home.

_Then there's the box I'm accumulating parts in, and the pink router-templates for making the frame._

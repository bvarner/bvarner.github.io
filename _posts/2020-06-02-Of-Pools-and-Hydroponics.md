The pool has been a hit. Any day over 80, and the kids have been in it. I'm thrilled.

Still trying to get the TA under control. I'm up to 3.5 gallons of acid now, and almost 11lbs of 'PH up' to counter it.

Looks like floating one 3" tablet in the floater does the trick for chlorine, and with the pool cover on at night it
 seems to be holding quite stable.

Water is cold right now (~73 in the mornings) and up to 80 in the afternoons. The sun doesn't hit the warming mat
 until almost 1PM, which is a bit later in the day than I'd like, but it's fine for now.
 
I seem to be in a good routine of getting the cover on and off, skimming, vacuuming, and what-not. The maintenance is
 taking about 15 minutes a day right now. Which adds up to a decent coffee-break in the morning. It's supposed to get
 mid 80's today. I may have to take an afternoon dip.

I've been able to shift focus back to the Pidroponics project. The uHAT has been sent off to PCBWay. They've fabbed 5
 boards for me, now I wait a couple months for the china post packet to make it here.

Meanwhile I've validated all the hardware works the way it should, and the kernel and driver configs are all setup to
 properly expose the data collection and control points to userland software. Yay! I've been watching the LEDS on
  this relay board for the last three days to make sure it's functioning long-term the way I'd expect. So far, so good.
